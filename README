This extension allows source code to be syntax highlighted on the wiki pages.
This README file might be out of date, have a look at the extension page
for updated informations:

    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi

== Requirements ==

This version of the extension has been tested with Pygments 1.6, 2.0.2 and
MediaWiki 1.25 as of 2015-06-19. To get releases of this extension compatible
with earlier versions of MediaWiki, visit:

    https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi


== Installation ==

First, you will need to ensure that this extension's Composer-managed
dependencies are available. In your root MediaWiki directory, create a
composer.local.json file with the following contents:

    {
        "extra": {
            "merge-plugin": {
                "include": [
                    "extensions/SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi/composer.json"
                ]
            }
        }
    }

Then run 'composer update'.

Next, Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:

    wfLoadExtension( 'SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi' );

You will also need to install Pygments, the syntax highlighting library that
this extension uses. On Ubuntu, Debian, RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora, you can use
your package manager to install the 'python-pygments' package. On other
systems, you can (usually) 'pip install pygments'. For additional help in
obtaining and installing Pygments, please see:

    http://pygments.org/download/

== Usage ==

On the wiki page, you can now use "source" elements:

<source lang="php">
<?php
    v = "string";    // sample initialization
?>
html text
<?php
    echo v;         // end of php code
?>
</source>

== Parameters ==

For details information of these parameters, see the documentation of Pygments'
HtmlFormatter at <http://pygments.org/docs/formatters/#HtmlFormatter>.

* lang;		Defines the language.
* line;		Corresponds to linenos="inline" option.
* start;	Corresponds to linenostart opion.
* highlight;    Corresponds to hl_lines option (comma separated).

== Note ==

Pygments is generous about creating HTML elements: highlighting large blocks of
code can easily generate enough of them to crash a browser. As a guard, syntax
highlighting is turned off for code fragments larger than 100 kB.
